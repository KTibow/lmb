{"name":"folsom-exp-v1.5","multimodal":false,"context":"The primary buzz around **folsom-exp-v1.5** is its recent announcement by `davidszd` as a \"New Amazon model.\" Beyond this initial mention, there's no further discussion or specific details regarding its performance or capabilities within this chat excerpt."}
{"name":"goldmane","multimodal":true,"context":"The anonymous model \"goldmane\" on LMArena is generating considerable excitement, with users largely speculating it's an advanced checkpoint or the upcoming general release of **Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro**. It's widely praised for its **high intelligence** and remarkable capabilities, frequently described as \"cracked,\" \"crazy smart,\" and an \"explanation god.\"\n\nUsers report goldmane excelling in complex reasoning and creative tasks, such as creating an interactive, self-refuting demonstration to debunk a philosophical position, and accurately recalling highly specific, detailed information like Roblox webpage analytics. It has reportedly **outperformed Claude Opus** in multiple runs and is considered a significant upgrade over previous models. Its code formatting is also a standout feature, noted for being \"beautiful\" and \"fancy\" with distinctive \"gradient indents.\"\n\nWhile there's ongoing debate about whether goldmane or \"redsword\" (another anonymous Gemini 2.5 Pro candidate) is superior, with some initial tests favoring redsword for \"hard tasks\" like pure math, many users lean towards goldmane for its broader general intelligence and sophisticated outputs. The recent removal of redsword from the arena further fuels speculation that goldmane is the version slated for imminent public release."}
{"name":"stephen","multimodal":false,"context":"The anonymous model \"stephen\" has recently appeared on the LM Arena, sparking considerable discussion.\n\nInitially, much of the buzz centered around its potential identity, with several users speculating it might be the new DeepSeek R1 model. However, this theory was later disputed, with one user noting that the official R1 is already named on the arena and \"stephen\" performs \"much less good at coding\" in comparison. There was even a speculative mention of it possibly being a pre-Grok-3.5 release.\n\nRegarding its behavior, a notable characteristic reported is its tendency to answer in Chinese, even when prompted in other languages. While some users found it \"over good,\" its coding ability was specifically called out as being inferior to other known models. Interestingly, \"stephen,\" along with other new models like \"x-preview,\" was mentioned in the context of a broader bug on the LM Arena where models might be displaying incorrect names or routing to different underlying models, potentially influencing its observed behavior."}
{"name":"X-preview","multimodal":false,"context":"`X-preview` is one of the new, anonymous models recently spotted in the LM Arena's Beta environment, sparking discussion among users.\n\n**Key Observations & Community Sentiment:**\n\n*   **Origin:** It is widely believed to be a model from **Baidu**, with some users speculating it might be an iteration of \"ernie x1 (reasoning model).\"\n*   **Initial Behavior:** One notable characteristic observed was its tendency to **respond in Chinese unprompted** when first prompted, although subsequent interactions then switched to English.\n*   **Performance:** The general consensus on its performance has been rather **underwhelming**. Users reported it as \"nothing to write home about,\" stating it \"didn't perform or feel like grok,\" and one user candidly concluded it \"sucks lol.\"\n*   **Arena Bugs:** `X-preview` has also been mentioned in the context of potential bugs within the Arena itself, where models might be misidentified, display incorrect names, or route to different models, potentially affecting how `X-preview` is perceived or behaves."}
